# Matlab-Scripts-For-Landsat-Kelp

This repository contains a series of MATLAB scripts for introductory spatial data analysis using Landsat-derived kelp canopy products.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB R2025a or newer** (required for the packages and functions used in this repository)

## Data
The example dataset is provided as a NetCDF (.nc) file containing kelp canopy biomass and area estimates on a consistent gridded spatial framework at 30 m resolution, along with supporting metadata. For greater detail on the data products, please see [Kelpwatch: A new visualization and analysistool to explore kelp canopy dynamics revealsvariable response to and recovery frommarine heatwaves][paper].

You can visualize the data on [KelpWatch](https://kelpwatch.org/).  
You can download the dataset from the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=74).
